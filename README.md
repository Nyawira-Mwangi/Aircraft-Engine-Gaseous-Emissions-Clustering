# Aircraft Engine Gaseous Emissions Clustering

This repository contains a project that applies clustering techniques to analyze aircraft engine gaseous emissions. The goal is to identify patterns and group engines with similar emission profiles, contributing to better understanding and tracking of net-zero initiatives.

## Project Overview

Aircraft engine emissions are a major concern for environmental sustainability. This project aims to cluster aircraft engines based on their gaseous emissions, enabling stakeholders to:

- Identify emission patterns across different engines.
- Classify engines with similar emission characteristics.
- Support decision-making for emissions reduction and compliance with net-zero targets.

##  Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: The dataset consists of gaseous emissions from various aircraft engines.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the dataset, handling missing values, and scaling the data for better clustering performance.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Extracting and selecting relevant features from the emissions data to enhance clustering accuracy.

4. **Clustering Models**: Applying unsupervised learning algorithms, including:
   -  K-Means Clustering
   -  DBSCAN
